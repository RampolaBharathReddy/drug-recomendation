The Drug Recommendation System using Explainable AI (XAI) is a machine learning-based healthcare project designed to recommend appropriate drugs based on patient medical data.

Unlike traditional black-box models, this system integrates Explainable AI techniques to provide transparent and interpretable predictions. The model not only recommends a drug but also explains why a particular recommendation was made.

This improves trust, transparency, and reliability in AI-driven healthcare systems.
